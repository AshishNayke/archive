Welcome to my repository archives! 🌐 As I work on my main project, I’ve been creating various dummy websites to test ideas, layouts, and functionalities. These repositories contain experimental designs, prototypes, and practice builds—some polished, others purely for testing. While they aren’t meant for production, they might be useful as references or starting points for new projects. Feel free to explore and use them however you like!
